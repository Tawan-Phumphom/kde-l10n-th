msgid "With the By Pair mode turned off, any two images can be compared by dragging the first image from the thumb bar to the left comparison pane, and then the second image to the right comparison pane. A little arrow will indicate which copy is shown in which pane. The current selected pane will be highlighted by a frame. If the two images have the same aspect ratio and you choose **Synchronize** from the toolbar, any zoom and panning in one window will be synchronously executed in the other pane. This allows you to easily compare the same areas in the two images."

msgid "The By Pair mode is better suited for quickly culling from a series of images. If you choose **By Pair** from the toolbar, the two sequential images from the thumbbar will be automatically inserted into the comparison panes. Click on any thumbnail to make it the left side preview, the adjacent thumbnail to the right will be inserted into the right pane. That makes it easy to sift through a series of similar images. And this sifting can be done with or without the Synchronized mode."
